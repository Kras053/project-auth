# Project Auth API

This week was a pair programming project where we built a fullstack application: a form to register a user and a log in function to reveal a secret page to the authenticated user, and handling the passwords in a secure way. 
 

## The problem
We built a registration flow handling the authentication of the user both in the frontend and in the backend and displaying error messages to help the user register/log in.
We used bcrypt to encrypt the passwords and store them in our database.
 
If we would have more time we would change the login page to show distinct difference from successfully register a user from the option to log in. 
Also we would use another solution for our log out button.
